# Hack with Ansible

Getting into the habit of flattening my lab machines regularly with some automation to help out.

## Warning

This repo is very much work in progress. You'll find 

# Arch VM Install script

Another WIP, this should be downloaded, then run, not piped to sh. You'll need
to interact with it. Try:

```bash
~$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackfell/ansible-hax/main/arch_vim_install.sh > install.sh && sh -x ./install.sh | tee install.log
```
